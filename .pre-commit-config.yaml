# This config file uses `repo: local` to ensure that all tools
# use the same versions both locally and in the pre-commit hooks.
# Since local repos cannot use the `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file,
# we have to manually define the hooks here, based on the hooks
# as defined in the tools' upstream repo.
