    "\n",
    "To enable data versioning we should save the `ref` of the specific datasets. `ref` can be a branch we are pulling a file from LakeFS. `ref` can be also a commit id - then you can access different data versions within the same branch and not only the version from the latest commit. Therefore, we will use explicit versioning and get the actual commit SHA. We have multiple ways to do this. Manually, we could go into the lakeFS UI, select the training branch, and navigate to the \"Commits\" tab. There, we could see the second-latest commit, titled `Add train-test split of 2010s weather data`, and copy its ID.\n",
