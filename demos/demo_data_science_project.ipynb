Therefore, we will use explicit versioning and get the actual commit SHA. We have multiple ways to do this. Manually, we could go into the lakeFS UI, select the training branch, and navigate to the \"Commits\" tab. There, we could see the latest two commits, titled `Add file test_weather.csv` and `Add file train_weather.csv`, and copy their IDs.\n",
