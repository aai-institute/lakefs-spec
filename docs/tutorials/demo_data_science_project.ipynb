    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will complete a small end-to-end data science tutorial that employs `lakeFS-spec` for data versioning. We will use weather data to train a random forest classifier to predict whether a given day from now is a raining day given the current weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do the following:\n",
    "* Environment setup\n",
    "* lakeFS setup\n",
    "* Data ingestion\n",
    "    * Transactions\n",
    "    * PUT a file\n",
    "* Model training\n",
    "* Updating data and retraining a model\n",
    "* Accessing data versions and Reproducing Experiments\n",
    "* Using a tag instead of a commit SHA for semantic versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "To execute the code in this tutorial as a Jupyter notebook, download this `.ipynb` file to a convenient location on your machine. You can also clone the whole `lakefs-spec` repository. During the execution of this tutorial, in the same directory, a folder 'data' will be created. We will also download a file `.lakectl.yaml` to the current user's home directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites before we start:\n",
    "* Python 3.9 or higher\n",
    "* Docker Desktop installed - [see guidance](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)\n",
    "* git installed\n",
    "\n",
    "# Environment Setup\n",
    "To set up the environment, run the following commands in your console:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m venv .venv`\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS and Linux:\n",
    "\n",
    "`source .venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`.venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the libraries necessary for this notebook on the environment you have just created: \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install notebook lakefs-spec numpy pandas scikit-learn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a terminal, start a Jupyter notebook server if one is not already running, by executing `jupyter notebook`. Double click the notebook to autostart a kernel using the created virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# lakeFS Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure you have Docker Desktop or a similar runtime available and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up LakeFS. You can do this by executing the following `docker run` command (the lakeFS quickstart) in your console:\n",
    "\n",
    "`docker run --name lakefs --pull always --rm --publish 8000:8000 treeverse/lakefs:latest run --quickstart`\n",
    "\n",
    "Open a browser and navigate to the lakeFS instance - by default: http://localhost:8000/. \n",
    "\n",
    "Authenticate with the following credentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Access Key ID    : AKIAIOSFOLQUICKSTART\n",
    "    Secret Access Key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY\n",
    "\n",
    "As an email, you can enter anything, we won't need it in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we instantiate the filesystem connector `LakeFSFilesystem`, we need to configure authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to authenticate to lakeFS from Python code - in this tutorial, we choose the convenient YAML file configuration. Execute the code below to download the YAML file including the lakeFS quickstart credentials and server URL to your user directory."

    "\n",
    "To enable data versioning we should save the `ref` of the specific datasets. `ref` can be a branch we are pulling a file from LakeFS. `ref` can be also a commit id - then you can access different data versions within the same branch and not only the version from the latest commit. Therefore, we will use explicit versioning and get the actual commit SHA. We have multiple ways to do this. Manually, we could go into the lakeFS UI, select the training branch, and navigate to the \"Commits\" tab. There, we could see the second-latest commit, titled `Add train-test split of 2010s weather data`, and copy its ID.\n",
